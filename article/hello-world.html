      <h1>Hello World</h1>
      <p>
        Well isn't this iconic...? ...ironic?
        <br /><br />

        What better well to start my blog then with a Hello World post. If you
        are not sure what this is all about then clearly you aren't a coder or
        have only started your journey.

        <br /><br />

        Hello World is normally the first thing that you code when you are
        learning a coding language. It is the text of your first webpage and the
        first thing you print to your site using Javascript.

        <br /><br />

        So it would be rude not to follow on tradition with a throwback.

        <br /><br />

        Back to the Hello World, this is my first post on my blog to tell you
        part of my story and how I am here right now writing this post.
        <br /><br />

        <h2>Can You Hear The Music?</h2>

        It came from a lack of something to do. Back in 2001 I had lost my job
        and was at home doing nothing with my life. One of my passions
        throughout my life was music. So I got into my head, why not share with
        people my love for music?

        <br /><br />

        Things started out with a blogger account but it wasn't long before I
        stumbled across Wordpress where I bought my first domain and my first
        website went live.

        <br /><br />
      </p>
      </div>

        <div class="article__wrapper"><img class="article__img"  src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dbwsa4cgf/image/upload/v1587898245/craigdennis.me/article-images/Crowd_r64fhx.jpg" alt=""></div>

        
        <div class="article__body">
          Over the years that it was live, I managed to have multiple writers for
          the site and got myself tickets to some of the bigger festivals in the
          UK like YNOT festival, Global Gathering, No Tomorrow to name a few.
  
          <br /><br />
  
          As the years went by and with finally getting a full time job, the
          posting went from 5 times a week to only a handful, as my time spent on
          my site got smaller and smaller, until I made the tough decision to quit
          the site and focus on my full time job.
  
          <br /><br />
  
          <h2>How Can I App?</h2>
  
          From there I entered the world of app development and started to learn Swift so I can develop apps for 
          Apple products. I am not sure what the catalyst for this was but I had some ideas that I wanted to see
          if I could turn into an app.
  
          <br><br>
          It was probably a year into learning Swift before I launched my own app into the app store. It was nothing fancy,
          just a generic app that produce random items, such as numbers, countries, dice etc.
  
          <br><br>

          <div class="article__wrapper"><img class="article__img "src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dbwsa4cgf/image/upload/v1587898237/craigdennis.me/article-images/mockup_l1sq3k.png" alt=""></div>
  
          I was proud of myself for what I did.
  
          <br><br>
  
          I'm not sure what the reason was but my interest for coding kinda dwindle away and before I knew it
          I had put down my keyboard and left the Swift world.
  
          <br><br>
  
          <h2>I Like Food</h2>
  
          It was a few years later when working with the web came back into my
          life. One of my other passions in life is food. I must give credit to my
          girlfriend who transformed me from my boring food life to one that was
          more adventurous.
  
          <br /><br />
  
          This was when my food reviewing site come into existence. Once again on
          Wordpress, my love for writing that I developed from writing music
          reviews, inspired me to review food at restaurants local to me.
  
          <br /><br />
        </div>
       


        <div class="article__wrapper"><img class="article__img "src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dbwsa4cgf/image/upload/v1587898238/craigdennis.me/article-images/food_osuyeg.jpg" alt=""></div>

        <div class="article__body">After 8 months of so I had reviewed over 30 restaurants and that's when
          I made a grave mistake. I wanted to get some more traffic to my site, so
          I decide to post one of my reviews on a Facebook group.
  
          <br /><br />
  
          Wow.
  
          <br /><br />
  
          Haters gotta hate! I don't really communicate on social media at all as
          I tend to keep myself to myself. So haven't really been exposed to the people that live on the Internet.
          Well, this was my first taste and all the hate was directed at me.
  
          <br><br>
          Some people did not agree with my opinions and expressed what they thought in a not so kind manner.
          I tried not to let it get to me but it was hard not to so I made the decision to close the site.
  
          <br><br>
  
          <h2>Making Websites and Beyond</h2>
  
          All went quite on the coding front until we decide at work to re-design our website as it was very outdated.
          We got a company in do it as I wasn't up for the challenge myself, and due to my knowledge of Wordpress, we 
          made it with that. (which was a mistake I wish i knew what I was making).
  
          <br><br>
  
          After a lot of money and lots of input from myself we finally had a website.
  
          <br><br>
          All was going well until the work that the company did was start breaking with Wordpress update. This was when
          my journey into coding started up again, learning HTML, CSS and Javascript.
  
          <br><br>
          And that bring us here today. I have been learning HTMl, CSS and Javascript since Jan 2020 and I have managed to 
          make a few website from scratch, including this one.
  
          <br><br>
  
          My plan is to continue with my skills and to use this blog to share with you the things that I learn to help
          you learn a thing or not and to use it as a reference point for myself.
  
          <br><br>
          You might see more than just coding as why the hell not. So expect to see marketing and copywriting as a few others
          thing that interest me.
  
          <br><br>
          Thank you for your time and see you all soon
          <br><br>
          Craig</div>
