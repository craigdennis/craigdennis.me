      <h1>Hello World</h1>
      <p>
        Well isn't this iconic...? ...ironic?
        <br /><br />

        What better way to start my blog than with a Hello World post. If you
        are not sure what this is all about then clearly you aren't a coder or
        have only just started your coding journey.

        <br /><br />

        Hello World is normally the first task that you achieve when you are learning to code.
        Typically it's the first words that appear on your app or website when you are first starting out.

        <br /><br />

        So it would be rude not to follow on tradition.

        <br /><br />

        Back to the Hello World, this is my first post on my blog, telling you my story 
        and how I am here, right now, writing this post.
        <br /><br />

        <h2>Can You Hear The Music?</h2>

        It came from a lack of something to do. Back in 2001 I had lost my job
        and was at home doing nothing with my life. One of my passions
        throughout my life was music. So I got into my head, why not share my love for music?

        <br /><br />

        I started out with a blogger account but it wasn't long before I
        stumbled across Wordpress. I bought my first domain and my first
        website went live.

        <br /><br />
      </p>

        <div class="article__wrapper"><img class="article__img"  src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dbwsa4cgf/image/upload/v1587898245/craigdennis.me/article-images/Crowd_r64fhx.jpg" alt=""></div>

        
        <div class="article__body">

          Over the years the site grew with multiple writers producing content
          and festivals letting us in for reviews. We ended up at some of the bigger festivals in the
          UK like YNOT festival, Global Gathering and No Tomorrow to name a few.
  
          <br /><br />
  
          As the years went by and with a full-time job in my life, content on the site started to dwindle
          due to my lack of time. And I had to make the tough decision to quit
          the site and focus on my full-time job.
  
          <br /><br />
  
          <h2>How Can I App?</h2>
          
          I am not sure what the catalyst for this was but I had some ideas that I wanted to see
          if I could turn into an app. This is where I entered the world of app development,
          developing with Swift language. 
        
          <br><br>
          It was probably a year into learning Swift before I launched an app into the app store. It was nothing fancy.
          Just a generic app that produced random items, such as numbers, countries, dice etc.
  
          <br><br>

          <div class="article__wrapper"><img class="article__img "src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dbwsa4cgf/image/upload/v1587898237/craigdennis.me/article-images/mockup_l1sq3k.png" alt=""></div>
  
          I was proud of what I achieved.
  
          <br><br>
  
          I'm not sure what the reason was but my interest in coding kinda dwindle again. And before I knew it
          I had put down my keyboard and left the Swift world.
  
          <br><br>
  
          <h2>I Like Food</h2>
  
          It was a few years later when working with the web came back into my
          life. One of my other passions in life is food. I must give credit to my
          girlfriend who transformed me from my boring food life to to a more adventurous one.
  
          <br /><br />
  
          This was when my food reviewing site came into existence. Once again on
          Wordpress, my love for writing that I developed from writing music
          reviews inspired me to review food at restaurants local to me.
  
          <br /><br />
        </div>
       


        <div class="article__wrapper"><img class="article__img "src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dbwsa4cgf/image/upload/v1587898238/craigdennis.me/article-images/food_osuyeg.jpg" alt=""></div>

        <div class="article__body">
          
          After 8 months or so I had reviewed over 30 restaurants and that's when
          I made a grave mistake. I wanted to get some more traffic to my site, so
          I decide to post one of my reviews on a Facebook group.
  
          <br /><br />
  
          Wow.
  
          <br /><br />
  
          Haters gotta hate! 
          
          <br><br>
          
          I don't communicate much on social media at all as
          I tend to keep myself to myself. So haven't been exposed to the people that live on the Internet.
          Well, this was my first taste and all the hate was directed at me.
  
          <br><br>
          Some people did not agree with my opinions and expressed what they thought in a not so kind manner.
          I tried not to let it get to me but it was hard not and it demotivated me to continue
          so I decided to close the site.
  
          <br><br>
  
          <h2>Making Websites and Beyond</h2>
  
          All went quiet on the coding front until we decided at work to re-design our website as it was very outdated.
          We got a company in do it as I wasn't up for the challenge myself. We made the decision to 
          have it made in Wordpress due to my knowledge of it. (which was a mistake I wish I knew what I was making).
  
          <br><br>
  
          After a lot of money and lots of input from myself, we finally had a website.
  
          <br><br>
          All was going well, until months and a few updates later, things started breaking. And trying to fix
          a Wordpress website that you didn't make is not fun at all.
          
          <br><br>
          
          This was when my journey into coding started up again; learning HTML, CSS and Javascript.
  
          <br><br>
          And that brings us here today. I have been learning HTMl, CSS and Javascript since Jan 2020. I have managed to 
          make a few websites from scratch, including this one.
  
          <br><br>
  
          I plan to continue with my skills and to use this blog to share with you the things that I learn.
  
          <br><br>
          You might see more than just coding as why the hell not. So expect to see posts about some of my other interests,
          like marketing and copywriting. 
      
          <br><br>
          Thank you for your time and see you all soon
          <br><br>
