      <h1>Hello World</h1>
      <p>
        Well isn't this iconic...? ...ironic?
        <br /><br />

        What better well to start my blog then with a Hello World post. If you
        are not sure what this is all about then clearly you aren't a coder or
        have only started your journey.

        <br /><br />

        Hello World is normally the first thing that you code when you are
        learning a coding language. It is the text of your first webpage and the
        first thing you print to your site using Javascript.

        <br /><br />

        So it would be rude not to follow on tradition with a throwback.

        <br /><br />

        Back to the Hello World, this is my first post on my blog to tell you
        part of my story and how I am here right now writing this post.
        <br /><br />

        It came from a lack of something to do. Back in 2001 I had lost my job
        and was at home doing nothing with my life. One of my passions
        throughout my life was music. So I got into my head, why not share with
        people my love for music?

        <br /><br />

        Things started out with a blogger account but it wasn't long before I
        stumbled across Wordpress where I bought my first domain and my first
        website went live.

        <br /><br />

        Over the years that it was live, I managed to have multiple writers for
        the site and got myself tickets to some of the bigger festivals in the
        UK like YNOT festival, Global Gathering, No Tomorrow to name a few.

        <br /><br />

        As the years went by and with finally getting a full time job, the
        posting went from 5 times a week to only a handful, as my time spent on
        my site got smaller and smaller, until I made the tough decision to quit
        the site and focus on my full time job.

        <br /><br />

        It was a few years later when working with the web came back into my
        site. One of my other passions in life is food. I must give credit to my
        girlfriend who transformed me from my boring food life to one that was
        more adventurous.

        <br /><br />

        This was when my food reviewing site come into existence. Once again on
        Wordpress, my love for writing that I developed from writing music
        reviews, inspired me to review food at restaurants local to me.

        <br /><br />

        After 8 months of so I had reviewed over 30 restaurants and that's when
        I made a grave mistake. I wanted to get some more traffic to my site, so
        I decide to post one of my reviews on a Facebook group.

        <br /><br />

        Wow.

        <br /><br />

        Haters gotta hate! I don't really communicate on social media at all as
        I tend to keep myself to myself.
