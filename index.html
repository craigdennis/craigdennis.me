            <p>
              Ted wanted a website building as an extension of his portfolio as
              an actor and a musician. The goal was to showcase Ted’s ability
              and to make getting in contact with him as easy as possible.
              <br />
              We achieved this by using his showcase video as the first thing
              you see when you get onto his site. We wanted whoever was visiting
              his site to be able to see Ted’s ability right from the start. We
              also added all of the important information that would be need if
              someone was looking to hire Ted in a film. We included his bio,
              his headshots and the films he has starred in.

              This website is an example of a breakfast cafe. It contains a

              page that presents any offers that the cafe may have, a section to
              collect emails for direct email marketing and a gallery for any
              food image to display the food that customers can buy. This

            <p>
              Cover’d In Punk wanted a simple single page wesbite that is a home
              for all of their music and social links. We decided to code the
              website in HTML/CSS due to the fact that the website won’t be
              update that often. They were after a site that at a glance
              contained all the information revelant to their fans. To help the
              band get in contact with anyone that would like to hire them we
              added a contact form at the bottom.
